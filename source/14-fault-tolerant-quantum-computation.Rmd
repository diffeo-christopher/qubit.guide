# Fault-tolerant quantum computation {#fault-tolerant-quantum-computation}

> About more classical error correction and the **Hamming code**, how they generalise to quantum codes called **CSS codes**, including the **[[7,1,3]]-code**.
> Also about a family of quantum codes known as the **surface code** which have large distances, and stabilisers that can all be measured on small numbers of neighbouring qubits.
> Finally about computing in the presence of errors: logical gates and **fault tolerance**.
